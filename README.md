This project aims to design a functional flashlight integrated into a home-based environment. Using HTML and CSS, the structure and visual layout of the home and flashlight were carefully crafted to provide a realistic appearance. To enable the on/off functionality of the flashlight (torch), JavaScript was utilized to manage interactive behavior, making the light respond to user input dynamically.
